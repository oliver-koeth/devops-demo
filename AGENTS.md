# Agent Guidance

This repository is being built in **small, staged steps**. All contributors (including AI agents) must keep changes minimal, scoped, and aligned to the current stage.

## How to Work Here
- Make changes in **small, incremental steps**.
- Do **not** implement future-stage features early.
- Prefer documentation and structure over premature code.
- If unsure, add a short note to `docs/` rather than writing code.

## Stage Discipline
- **Stage 2 (current)**: Angular frontend MVP with localStorage persistence (see `frontend/` scope guidance).
- Stage 3 will add a Python backend and remove localStorage.
- Stage 4/5 will add MCP server + ChatGPT-native integration.
- If a request conflicts with the current stage, flag it clearly and stop.

## Stage Extensions
- For Stage 3+, avoid backend or MCP work unless explicitly requested.
- Prefer to extend documentation in `docs/` when uncertain.

## Output Expectations
- Keep repository changes clean and professional.
- Avoid scaffolding tools until explicitly requested in a later stage.
