# Frontend Stage Guidance

This directory is **Stage 3** for the demo application. The frontend remains an Angular MVP, but now relies on the backend API for persistence.

## Scope
- Implement the standalone Angular frontend that calls the FastAPI backend.
- Follow the staged roadmap: no MCP server or deployment tooling.

## Expectations
- Keep changes scoped to frontend MVP needs.
- Use standalone components and Angular router.
- Favor small, readable services for data access.

If a request would add MCP functionality, stop and flag the conflict.
