# Frontend Stage Guidance

This directory is **Stage 2** for the demo application. Frontend code may be created here to implement the Angular MVP described in the active task.

## Scope
- Implement the standalone Angular frontend with localStorage persistence.
- Follow the staged roadmap: no backend, MCP server, or deployment tooling.

## Expectations
- Keep changes scoped to frontend MVP needs.
- Use standalone components and Angular router.
- Favor small, readable services for data access.

If a request would add backend services or MCP functionality, stop and flag the conflict.
